## Description

Hi there! This is the repository for my personal portfolio website that I will be making changes to often. Currently, it is buit with just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. I hope to rebuild this website with JS libraries such as React in the future. <br> <br> This website's purpose is to showcase information about me such as my education, (future) work experience, and projects I have worked on. It has been tested with the Website Accessibility Evalulation Tool (WAVE) to make sure it is easily accessible to all users.
